      <title>Robust Realtime Shape Estimation of Deformable Linear Object</title>

      <description>Deformable Object Simulation Link to heading The existing methods of shape estimation of continuum objects create dense point clouds from camera images, and/or use distinguishable markers on a deformable body. They have natural limitations in realtime tracking of large continuum objects/manipulators and the physical occlusion of markers can often compromise accurate shape estimation. We propose a robust method to estimate the shape of linear deformable objects in realtime using scattered and unordered key points.</description>

      <description>PoseHub: Surgical Tool Tracking with AR Headset Link to heading We are developing a surgical tool tracking system that can be used with augmented reality headsets. The system is designed to provide real-time feedback to the surgeon about the location of the surgical tool. The system has a scene-graph structure that allows for easy integration with different tracking devices and visualization tools. A synthetic dataset is generated in ROS to test the system.</description>

      <description>Learning-based 2D/3D Fluoroscopic Image Registration Link to heading We developed and maintained an open-source python package xregi that is used to compute the projection matrix between 2D x-ray images and 3D CT scans. This process is also called as 2D/3D fluoroscopic image registration problem. The package is now available on Pypi. Install the pacakge through pip install xregi to try out!</description>

      <description>With our advanced robotic system, surgeons can easily and accurately deliver non-invasive stimulations to the cortical area of the brain. The system is designed to be easy to use and can be operated by a single person. The system is currently being tested in a clinical trial at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.</description>
