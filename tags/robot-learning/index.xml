      <description>Your browser does not support the video tag. [PDF] [Arxiv] [Website] [GitHub] Data scarcity has long been an issue in the robot learning community. Particularly, in safety-critical domains like surgical applications, obtaining high-quality data can be especially difficult. It poses challenges to researchers seeking to exploit recent advancements in reinforcement learning and imitation learning, which have greatly improved generalizability and enabled robots to conduct tasks autonomously.&#xA;In this work, we introduce dARt Vinci, a scalable data collection platform for robot learning in surgical settings.</description>
